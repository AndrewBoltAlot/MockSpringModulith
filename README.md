Implementation: 
Spring Modulith promotes Domain-Driven Design principles, encouraging the division of applications into distinct modules based on business domains.
Modularity involves dividing a software system into interchangeable components or modules.
However it remains a monolithic architecture as in spring modulith the sub-packages of the main packages are what we consider modules.

The interaction between the User and Authentication modules is an example of internal method invocation within a monolithic application, leveraging the modular structure for clear separation of concerns and maintainability. 

This modular but unified approach is a key feature of the Spring Modulith paradigm.
